# Project Description: 
A restaurant finder website that is RestroCompass is an online platform that helps users find and discover restaurants in their area or in a specific location. The website provides a database of restaurants, including information such as the restaurant's name, location, cuisine type, menu, prices, ratings, reviews, and photos. 

Users can search for restaurants based on various criteria such as cuisine type, price range, location, distance, ratings, and availability of outdoor seating, delivery, and reservations. 

In addition to helping users find restaurants, the website may also provide additional features such as leaving a review, or adding a restaurant to their favorites list. Some restaurant finder websites may also offer discounts and deals for certain restaurants, and provide information about upcoming events or special offers.

Overall, a RestroCompass website is a convenient and helpful tool for foodies and travelers looking for new dining experiences or trying to find a restaurant that fits their preferences and needs.
